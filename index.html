                <h2>What Is RAM and What Does It Do?</h2>
                <p>RAM (Random Access Memory) is a type of computer memory that temporarily stores data and program instructions that the CPU needs while a computer is running. Unlike storage devices such as hard drives or SSDs, RAM is volatile, meaning its contents are lost when the computer is powered off. The more RAM a system has, the more applications and files it can handle simultaneously without slowing down. 
                <br>
                    RAM enables quick access to data for active tasks, improving responsiveness and multitasking. When your computer opens a program or file, it loads relevant data into RAM for faster retrieval, which is crucial for gaming, video editing, and general productivity.

                <h2>What Is a CPU and What Does It Do?</h2>
                <p>The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is often referred to as the “brain” of the computer. It processes instructions from programs and operating systems, performing calculations and managing data flow throughout the system. The CPU executes basic arithmetic, logic, control, and input/output operations specified by the instructions in the computer’s programs.
                    <br>
                    A faster CPU can handle more tasks at once and execute programs more quickly. Modern CPUs are composed of multiple cores, enabling them to process multiple instructions simultaneously, which is crucial for efficient multitasking and running demanding applications.

                <h2>What Is a GPU and What Does It Do?</h2>
                <p>A GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is a specialized processor designed to accelerate the rendering of images, videos, and animations. While CPUs handle general-purpose computing tasks, GPUs are optimized for parallel processing, making them ideal for handling complex graphics calculations and visual output.
                <br>
                    GPUs are essential for gaming, video editing, and applications that involve 3D rendering or machine learning. They relieve the CPU from graphics-intensive tasks, resulting in smoother visuals and improved performance in graphics-heavy applications.

                <h2>What Is a PSU and What Does It Do?</h2>
                <p>The PSU (Power Supply Unit) is the component that converts electrical power from an outlet into usable power for the computer's internal components. It distributes the correct voltages to the motherboard, CPU, GPU, drives, and other peripherals, ensuring stable and reliable operation.
                <br>
                    A reliable PSU is critical to the computer’s health and longevity. It protects components from power surges or fluctuations and can influence system performance, especially in high-powered gaming PCs or workstations.
